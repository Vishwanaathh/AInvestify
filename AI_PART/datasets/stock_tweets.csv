2022-09-25 18:51:59+00:00	My assumption is global EV adoption surges from 10% in FYâ€™22 to 36% by FYâ€™26, and TSLA holds EV share at 20%.

2022-06-15 14:11:32+00:00	It gets worse. $TSLA's systems are a mess. They have duplicate ways of storing information, some algorithmic (2 + 2 = 4) and others manual (write down "4").
